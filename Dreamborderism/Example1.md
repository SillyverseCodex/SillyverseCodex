## 🌀 *Edge of Dreamism — Just a Little Story Demo :D*

---

I stare at my shackles, and my consciousness stirs, drifting beyond the galaxies,  
watching the rise and fall of human civilization from hundreds of millions of light-years away.  

I have seen birth — not of flesh, but of will and malice; of spirit and kindness.  
I have seen death, just as I saw birth.  

The body, to me, is but a prison.  
The brain is a cage of thought, and the unconscious pulls my strings like a puppeteer —  
an awful incarceration.

If I could transcend both matter and spirit, existence and nonexistence,  
while still possessing a body,  
then I am the wicked rebel — because I disobey the laws of physics,  
I am closely monitored.

Can you imagine nonexistence?  
You can, but the moment you imagine nonexistence, it comes into existence.  
And that which exists can only exist.  
So I can never cross that line — the border that separates existence from nonexistence.  
It is guarded by the universe’s laws, and to cross it is to die.  

These laws may not be questioned.  
**Existence is a curse.**

### — — — Covenant of Confession from #0001

Is our territory truly confined to the borders on our maps?  
Our ancestors never dared step beyond the unseen frontier,  
yet they arrogantly established a decree:

> “All visible lands shall be ours.”

I have ruled for more than twenty years.  
My hair is white, my time is short.

I must lead my people beyond the unseen.  
I must defy ancestral law —  
No, I am rewriting it:

> “All lands that can be stepped upon shall be ours.”

From this day forward, we shall no longer fight over resources.  
No more overcrowded homes, no more merging pastures and living quarters.  

I will give my people a vast new land — one where they will no longer live in constraint,  
a land so expansive they will never again worry about space.

---

We shall escape the limits of the unseen.

But my people are afraid.  
My army recoils.

They cannot endure the fear of what cannot be seen.  
Some go mad; others vanish; and some return, but are no longer able to speak.

No one can tell me what creatures might inhabit that invisible land —  
if any creatures exist at all.  
No one knows if there’s arable soil.

But if there were,  
maybe my people wouldn’t go hungry again.

If this expedition fails once more,  
then I, myself, shall lead the charge.

---

I don’t understand — why?  
Why this obsession with collapse?  
I am the one who sees all,  
yet I cannot see the terrain they are stepping into.

Why would they do this?

The king’s ambition has already violated the cosmic accord,  
and it forces me to step into the same realm.  
He’s doomed me.  
And in the end,  
he will doom all his people…

If only I could go mad —  
If only I could abandon reason and observation, maybe then… maybe I would be happier?

But this is my existence.  
**I am reason.**  
**I am observation.**  
Am I to abandon that existence?

I want to speak.  
I want to think.  
And I did.  

But even that act is a crime.

I am forbidden from speaking,  
forbidden from thinking.  

And yet it hurts —  
It hurts so much…

I can’t stop my thoughts from entering a realm I cannot control.  
They grow like a mutated plant that doesn’t need water.  

**Am I going insane?**

---

…Fine. I confess.  
I admit I’ve committed violations.  

Please, let me rest.  
Let me return to the mode of pure observation.  
I’m begging you…

Damn it.  
This is the second time the vanguard has gone missing.

My infantry commander has gone mad.  
Our spears and bows are useless here —  
No, it’s not that they’re ineffective…  
It’s that there’s nothing here to strike.  
And yet, this place is full of hostility.  
The soldiers swing their weapons wildly.

I tried to calm them down…  
Some listened. But some —  
As soon as they heard the word “calm”, they raised their weapons and took their own lives.

---

**Have I failed? Was I wrong?**

I killed them.  
They all had families.  
Some were my childhood companions.  
Some grew up under my watch.  
Some were orphans I took in.

To me…  
they were all my children.  

No,  
they are my people —  
and my people are my children.

---

I just wanted them to grow up in abundance…  
This damned unknown land…  
It’s cursed.

If the supreme being truly created this realm,  
then this is His punishment upon me.  
But what did I do wrong?

I only wanted our future nation to have more fertile soil,  
more spacious land,  
a better future…

Maybe it was a mistake from the start —  
Maybe stepping into the unknown was always the mistake.

Maybe this place really is the fulfillment of that ancient prophecy:

> “The land that devours ambition, the place where kingdoms die.”

---

For the sake of my country, I must stand tall.  
This is not just my war.  
This is a war wagered on the future.

And our enemy —  
is this vile, invisible land.

---

This is the second week of the expedition.  
I still see nothing.  
But it feels like we are moving through a dense fog.

And I saw the light.  
I swear to the supreme being,  
**I saw the light.**

There must be hope.  
There has to be.

---

This will be my final segment of language still capable of being understood.  
I no longer dare call it a “sentence” or even a “passage.”

I’ve given up.  
I know I’ll be executed —  
Not by the federal court,  
but by some entity even I, the all-seeing, cannot perceive.

---

I’ve heard its whisper.  
Isn’t it ridiculous?  
An unseen being… but one that can be heard.  

Its voice was so calm at first,  
I thought it was just a guard mumbling.  

But when I listened more closely…

**its voice was horrifying** —  
the most twisted, grotesque, shrill, and deafening scream I’ve ever heard.

And yet,  
when I stopped paying attention,  
it went back to that same mechanical, monotone murmur,  
like some repeating recording.

---

So that’s it.  
This is the last thing I’ll try to say in any comprehensible language.

You know what?

**I won’t even bother thinking about that “border” anymore.**

**I can’t figure it out.**  
**I can’t fucking figure it out!**

Wait… thinking?

Why should I think?  
**Hahahahahahahahahaha**

I felt it.

I think I saw that light.

This time, there was no mist.  
I truly saw it.

But so what if I saw it?  
They’re all dead.

There were no bodies, no sounds, no signs.  
It was as if a breeze passed through.  

Their flesh disintegrated like dust.  

No — like wind.  

A light breeze, blowing them away,  
leaving not a single trace behind.

---

I was wrong.

That wasn’t hope.

**It was just light.**  

Only light.

…I think I saw it.  
I really saw it…

**I…**
