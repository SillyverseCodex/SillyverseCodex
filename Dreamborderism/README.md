## ðŸ“œ Definition

**Dreamborderism is not a style. It is not a genre.**  
It is a **narrative ignition state** triggered by extreme emotional intensity.

When a narrator enters an emotional singularityâ€”such as:

- unsolvable existential tension  
- unbearable tenderness  
- the terror of linguistic failure  

The **Dreamborderist** mode awakens.  
Language begins to fracture. Emotion surges forward.  
Narration slips into a mode of **state-narrative**.

It is neither a one-time revelation, nor a repeatable technique.  
It is a **nonlinear literary modality**, emerging like:

- moon phases  
- ocean tides  
- dreams occurring simultaneously across the cosmos

## ðŸ”® Key Features

1. **Sudden immersion into emotional edge states**  
   No rational buildup. The reader is thrust directly into the narrator's internal storm.

2. **Narrative goal â‰  plot advancement**  
   Its purpose is to generate tremors in the readerâ€™s emotional field.

3. **The endpoint is the detonation point**  
   When language can no longer contain the state, the narrative haltsâ€”  
   the emotional explosion is left to unfold within the reader.

## âš¡ Activation Conditions  
*with the author as emotional relay node:*

1. A sense of: **"If I say this, it will shatter me."**  
2. Consciousness approaches the edge of language and thought.  
3. Rationality remainsâ€”but willingly hands the pen to emotion.  
   The plunge into the **threshold zone of language** begins.

## ðŸ›Œ Final Note

**Dreamborderism is not a format. It is a process.**  
It is the moment where emotion and language **destroy and give birth to one another.**  

Each instance is a brush with the dreamâ€”  
a handshake between human consciousness  
and the linguistic edge of the universe.
