# 👾🎀 Mini Story: Diary of the Alien Girl and Her Blown-up Worlds (teehee)

## 🌌 Star Year 1223 — The universe is still cold. Cocoa is still frozen. *(nice)*

Today that bald guy told me to go scan another trash world for destruction clearance.  
**Ugh I don’t wanna work!!**  
But I gotta earn cash to buy that adorable galaxy pudding bracelet :((

Anyway, the nav says we’re just a few lightyears away from a place called **Earth**.  
No clue what their civilization’s like.  
If it sucks, I’ll just blow it up. **WAHAHAHA**

*(She spills glitter in the corner, then sticks on a ribbon and pudding stickers)*

## 🌍 Earth Year 2188, Mid-July — Warfront

**Commander (Country A):**  
> Sugar! Where’s the sugar?!  
> You! Yes, you—get over here!  
> We’re low on sugar and eggs!  
> And YOU! Stop taste-testing and start stirring!  
> What does the nation even pay you pudding-heads for!?

**Soldier (Country A):**  
> S-sir… we ran out of sugar…  
> We… we might have to eat their pudding until we explode…

**Commander (Country A):**  
> Never! Not in a thousand years!  
> I’d rather eat eggshells than their filthy pudding!!

**General (Country B):**  
> WAHAHAHAHAHA! Surrender already!  
> Our pudding is superior!!  
> Hey you! Gimme the mic!  
> Turn the volume all the way up!!  
> *(Soldiers prep the mic. The general starts singing the Pudding Anthem)*

## 🌌 Star Year 1223 — Earth — No Cocoa Powder. Boo.

Even without cocoa powder, I’m super happy today!  
I flipped through the Cosmic Almanac and thought Earth was a **rotten war planet**.  
Like, *“everyone’s punching everyone”* rotten.

But NOPE!  
It’s a **giant pudding rave!!**  
I LOVE IT.

> Truly, today the universe has been blessed by pudding. Ha!

## 🌍 Earth Year 2188, Late August — Post-War Surrender

**Prime Minister (Country A):**  
> On behalf of Country A, we hereby surrender all occupied territory to Country B,  
> and accept judgment from the United Pudding Council.

**Citizens (Country A):**  
> Ughhh what a dumb government.  
> You lost the war?!  
> Who’s gonna inherit my grandma’s pudding recipe now?! Waaahhh 😭

**Another Citizen:**  
> Shhh. Watch your words.  
> If the secret chocolate police catch you,  
> they’ll force you to read Country B’s pudding recipe for three whole minutes.

And so, while Country B spread its pudding empire…  
Country A’s pudding lived on, **hidden in every household drawer**.  
A quiet **Pudding Vengeance Movement** was rising.

## 🌌 Star Year 1223 — Earth War Ends. Pudding Era Begins.

Today, I saw a nation give up their pudding…  
and it made me sad. 😢

But to be fair, Country B’s pudding **is** tastier.

Still… if I could choose,  
I’d want everyone’s pudding to be equally yummy.  
**Why fight over pudding?**

Since humans no longer punch each other flat-flat,  
there’s no need to blow them up.  

**Decision made: I’m staying on Earth.**  
Forget that dumb job. **HAHAHAHAHA!**

*Since then, the alien girl disguised herself as a human and now lives a happy life eating pudding every day.*  
*(Oh and she has superpowers so she makes money fast)*  
*(But the Galactic Union forbids power usage, so she’s technically a fugitive now — but it was worth it. 10/10.)*
