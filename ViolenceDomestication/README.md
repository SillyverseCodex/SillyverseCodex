# 🔥 Theory of Violence Domestication

> *If wars were all cooking competitions, this world would never suffer casualties again.*

---

## 🎯 Claim:

Violence is not an **outcome**, but a **momentum**.  
The world keeps fighting and people keep dying — **bad 👎!**  
This comes from the silly (and tragic) equation:

**Violence = Destruction**

But in truth, violence is just an **ignition** — a **pre-action energy**.  
So if we flip the equation into:

**Violence = Creation**

Then we no longer spiral in that dumb loop of  
**“I punch you flat, you punch me flatter”** 👍

---

From a psychological view, think of `Violence = Creation`  
as a cute cousin of:

**Trauma — Sublimation**
(I forgot who said it but who cares 😸)  

As long as we treat violence as **momentum**  
and guide it toward **creative output**,  
humanity’s conflicts will become a **super cool creation loop** ✨

## 🌀 Before vs After Domestication

**Old Era:**

> “You suck! 😠😠 I’ll beat you up!”  
> Then someone gets beaten up, and someone else starts beating back (bad 👎)

**Post-Domestication:**

> “You suck! 😠😠 I’m gonna write a poem so angry it makes you feel my wrath 😡🤯🤯”  
> The other person gets mad too — writes a poem back —  
> and BAM! cooler and cooler poetry is born 😤🔥🎤

Or… maybe it’s a **pudding war**,  
where everyone competes to make the best handcrafted pudding ever —  
and eventually we invent a **galaxy-tier pudding** 😱🥰

## 🧠 Civilizational Perspective

Early humans solved disputes through:  
> **“Who kills who first”** 😤😩

But now?  
We lower death risk through:

- 🗣️ Debate  
- 💰 Economy  
- 💻 Info wars  

So why not go further?  
Let’s **fully domesticate violence** and turn it into **creative output**.

✨ This is the **Theory of Violence Domestication** ✨

## ❗️But Wait—Risks?

Yes, there are risks.  
Like, what if we get **terrorists in this system**?

Example:  
If conflicts are resolved via culinary warfare,  
a terrorist might invent a **virus that erases taste buds** 🤢

But guess what?  
That would also push **medical science** forward:

**taste-loss = sadness = fix it please 😼**
(...I ran out of ideas here so I’ll let smart humans inspired by this theory come up with more 😸)

## 👽 Scaredy-humans might ask:

> “But if we give up weapons, how do we fight off aliens? 😿”

**LOL. Let me tell you:**

1. If aliens are super OP:  
   - They’ll ignore us or obliterate us instantly 😐💥  
   - Or they’ll protect us because our pudding is too delicious 🍮🛸

2. A civilization that only sees `Violence = Destruction`  
   probably can’t even fly out of their dumb little planet 🚫🌍 (losers)

3. Maybe there are no aliens.  
   But who cares?  
   We’re throwing the **happiest pudding party in the universe** 🙀😹

## That’s all, bye.
