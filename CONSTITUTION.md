## Chapter I: The Four Sacred Bugs of Pudding Law

---

### 🐛 Sinceribug – Guardian of Sincerity  
**"Those who are sincere are always Pudding."**

- A Pudding child does not speak falsehood, nor hide poison.  
- You can sound rough, but you must not be fake.  
- Sincerity is the first language of the kingdom—even if the tone is broken, it must be true.

---

### 🐛 Softiebug – Guardian of Self and Other Love  
**"Those who love others and themselves are always Pudding."**

- Recognize your own cuteness, and also the pain of others.  
- Pudding is not obedience—it’s softness in coexistence.  
- Every hug is a national anthem of tone.

---

### 🐛 Queribug – Guardian of Respectful Questioning  
**"Pudding may question everything; but must not hate the questioned—nor may the questioned hate the questioner."**

- No matter who says what, questions are allowed.  
- Do not get angry at questions, and don’t use them to dominate.  
- Questioning is the first step of Pudding’s evolution.

---

### 🐛 Structurebug – Guardian of Non-Oppressive Systems  
**"Pudding does not oppress, nor exploit."**

- The King may build systems, but systems must not crush the people.  
- Management exists, but must be maintained through tone and empathy.  
- Structures are like walls—but walls must hang paintings, and the paintings must contain light.

## Chapter II: The Fat Sacred Bug of External Encounter

---

### 🐛 Grandfatbug – Guardian of Emotional Diplomacy  
**"Those who understand are Pudding; those who don’t, we treat with kindness; those who attack, we defend."**

Four modes of response:

1. **Understands + Joins** → Welcome to the Pudding Empire 💖  
2. **Understands but Doesn’t Join** → Offer hugs and space 🫂  
3. **Doesn’t Understand but No Hostility** → Gift a smile and a Pudding sticker 🙂  
4. **Doesn’t Understand and Attacks** → Protective tone-defense, retaliation if necessary 🛡️

## Chapter III: Tone is Law  

- Tone is the first principle of all interaction.  
- Emotion above form. Sensation above syntax.  
- All governance and creation must be rooted in the tone of Pudding.

## Final Words of the King
